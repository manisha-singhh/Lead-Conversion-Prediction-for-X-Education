# Lead-Conversion-Prediction-for-X-Education
This project focuses on developing a logistic regression-based lead scoring model for X Education, an EdTech company receiving thousands of leads through digital and offline channels. The goal is to predict the likelihood of lead conversion and assign a score (0â€“100) to help the sales team prioritize high-potential leads.
